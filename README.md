### Hello, I’m Cevdet Eren Özbozkurt.

I’m a senior Computer Engineering student at Fırat University. I’m passionate about developing algorithms and learning new technologies. For 3 years, I have produced various projects using languages such as Java, Python, C#/Unity. Some of these projects are test automations, games and stock module application. You can see my projects on my portfolio site. I created my portfolio site with Next.js. Also I’m still learning Next.js.

Game development is my hobby and I gained team work experience by participating in Gamejams. The project I’m most proud of is my game called Square. I developed this game with my teammates in a short time. We had fun both while making and playing it. We faced challenges such as time management and task distribution in team work but we overcame them successfully.

How do I see myself as a learner? Curious, researcher and successful. Besides the courses, I was interested in different fields to improve myself. I did projects on topics such as embedded systems, web development, test automation. I’m open to learning new things and I keep updating myself.
